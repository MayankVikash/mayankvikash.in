A hospital in Gaza has been targeted amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict. The blast at the Gaza hospital has killed hundreds of Palestinians. The incident took place just before US President Joe Biden visited Israel as Israel was preparing for a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip to free it from the terrorists who attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. The conflict between Israel and Hamas terrorists has escalated as the terrorist organisation has captured more than a hundred foreign and Israeli citizens, and almost none of them can be verified to be alive right now. 

Amidst all these tensions, a civilian hospital in the Gaza Strip has been bombed. The international community has expressed their anger for the war crime and condolences for the victim. The international community want answers. Who had killed these innocent civilians?

The Palestinian government and Hamas have accused Israel of the bombings. On the other hand, Israeli Defence Forces has said that a "misfired rocket" from Hamas hit the hospital. The Israeli Government has released footage which it claims to be proof of Hamas rocket getting misfired. 

There are reports that it was probably a Hamas rocket and US data shows that Israel is not behind the attack. The United States has approved a hundred million dollars in humanitarian aid for Gaza and Israel has also approved of limited aid.

Israel's ambassador to India Naor Gilon said that the hospital in Gaza was hit by an Islamic Jihad Rocket. "Al Ahli Hospital was hit by a rocket of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad…They tried to hit our children, but on the way hit their own children…It’s really a pity that many around the world are cooperating with them. In our technological world, everything is documented. We have clear-cut evidence that it was a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. The Palestinian terrorists and their allies immediately take out their victim cards” the Ambassador to India said.

He also said that Hamas tried to attack Israel's innocent children but on the way of doing so hit their children. The Israeli Defence Forces has previously said that the only way to end the war and innocent killing of both sides is the complete eradication of Hamas and the regime which backs these terrorists.

US President Joe Biden has backed Israel's claims and said that based on the information he had seen the hospital blast appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group. Israel has received support from India and some Western countries have called for an investigation. without pointing the finger at this stage, while the Arab states have blamed Israel.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is "deeply shocked" by the deaths in the attack and extended his condolences to the families of those killed.

"Deeply shocked at the tragic loss of lives at the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, and prayers for speedy recovery of those injured. Civilian casualties in the ongoing conflict are a matter of serious and continuing concern. Those involved should be held responsible," the Prime Minister posted on [X](https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1714551508535296439?s=20), formerly Twitter.

Death of civilians should at all cost be avoided at the time of war. Even in World War II, civilian buildings like hospitals and universities were avoided.

Nothing could be done about those who are dead but acts like these should be avoided in the future. Blaming each other in a situation like this shows the unwise behaviour of both sides. There should be a proper investigation and Arab countries, being nearest should help in the investigation. The guilty should be punished accordingly.

The media should also play its role by not picking sides and labelling Israel or Hamas as responsible for the crime. The evidence as can be seen shows that the rocket was indeed misfired and hit the wrong target.
