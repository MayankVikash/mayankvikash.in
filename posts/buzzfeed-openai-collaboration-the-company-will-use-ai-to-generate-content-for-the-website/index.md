According to the reports, Buzzfeed, a New-York based digital media website decided to use OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate content including quizzes. They also stated that humans will still manage and create their news content.

In a memo, CEO Jonah Peretti informed his employees about the decision of using AI technologies to help the site make better content.

He said, "Over the next three years, the future of digital media will be defined by two major trends: **creators**, and **AI**."

Buzzfeed wants to shift from the algorithmic creation of feed and recommended content to AI-powered content recommendation.

Buzzfeed said it will use OpenAI to enhance and personalize its content for providing the experience to the users.

The news comes after the company announced that it will cut its workforce by about 12 percent.

The company didn't say that they will fire employees after the implementation of AI technologies is finished but it is sure they will hire experts with experience in AI and programming to implement the technology and maintain it.

BuzzFeed, Inc. is a New York-based American Internet media, news, and entertainment company with a focus on digital media. It was founded in 2006 by Jonah Peretti and John S. Johnson III to focus on tracking viral content.

The company employs 1700 people and has a revenue of $398 million according to 2021 data.

After the news has come, Buzzfeed's stocks have been increased by 85%.

Reports suggest, several websites already use AI to create content such as CNET and The Associated Press.

The decision follows after Microsoft announced an investment of $10 billion in OpenAI. I fear OpenAI will not have the same fate as other startups where you build a successful startup then some big company purchases it and after a few years abandons the project but that is not likely to happen as the coming decade will start the age of AI where every small work will be done by these AI robots and human will only be hired in the field of logical thinking, conducting research and exploring the outer space.

Microsoft will use AI in their Operating System, Search, Bing Discover, and other products to deliver a better experience to the users.

There are several companies other than Buzzfeed and Microsoft which are considering the implementation of AI in their products to improve user experience, performance, and overall product quality.

AI tools like ChatGPT can be very helpful in generating content like articles, stories, etc. They also generate a lot of wrong information. Recently, CNET found out that more than half of their articles generated with AI have the wrong information.

This will not be a serious problem in the future, with the improvement in technologies AI programs are becoming better every day. With the help of machine learning, AI programs can be taught new things and they can also learn from their previous mistakes and the mistakes of others.

Some people on the Internet are supporting the implementation of AI in their favorite products and are excited about how this new technology will change the way of consuming content. Some are against of implementation of AI as they don't want an AI program to decide what they want to consume.

For me, a mix of algorithmic and AI-selected and generated content would work.

One of the biggest problems with AI chatbots is that they are very convincing. OpenAI's ChatGPT can create convincing texts very easily. These AI programs could be used to create misleading information and could also be used for political benefits. When I was using ChatGPT, I came across a lot of points that I knew were wrong but ChatGPT express them so confidently that for a moment I thought that I was wrong.

Let's end this article with the decade-old question about privacy. Research has shown that user data is a fortune for companies. If you can create what the audience wants then you will become a billionaire dollar company in just a night.

With the implementation of AI programs, there is always a risk to users' privacy and data. AI programs can learn about a user's behavior with the help of machine learning and they can anytime send it to their owners without asking for the user's consent. So be careful about the services you install on your device and with whom you share your valuable data.

Read the memo by Jonah Peretti, the CEO of Buzzfeed:

> Hi all,
> 
> I want to share thoughts today on our strategy. As we continue to navigate through challenging times, our mission is more important than ever – to spread truth, joy, and creativity to the biggest, most diverse, most online audiences. We are fortunate to have a talented team, iconic brands, and a differentiated technology platform that allows us to stand out in a crowded market and have an unparalleled impact on culture. And, of course, the best of the Internet: lists, quizzes, and video from BuzzFeed; premium, award-winning series from Complex Networks; two of the largest food brands on the Internet in Tasty and First We Feast; and free, award-winning journalism from HuffPost and BuzzFeed News.
> 
> In the short term, we will fiercely focus on delivering strong value for our partners so that they continue to spend with us during the recession, and manage our costs and run our company like a lean, scrappy startup. In tough economic times, we need to fight for every penny of revenue, and try to save every penny of costs.
> 
> But the truth is that working hard for our partners and operating cost efficiently, while essential, will only get us so far. To fulfill the promise of our mission, we need to build a stronger business foundation by executing a forward-looking strategy. We must look ahead and shift our business towards longer term trends in order to seize the opportunities that will come in the eventual recovery.
> 
> Over the next three years, the future of digital media will be defined by two major trends: **creators**, and **AI**. We will help shape these trends to create massive value for our audience, our employees, and our shareholders. Working together, we will:
> 
> **Build the premier platform for creative people to do their most inspired work, reach the most people, and live their best lives.** Content will increasingly be produced by talent around the world who work for themselves and multiple companies. Broadly defined, I’ll refer to these people as “creators,” but they include people who you might also refer to as celebrities, actors, athletes, entertainers, freelancers, influencers, contributors, producers, community members, or talent. The best media companies will provide a differentiated creator platform to help creators succeed in a crowded market. The creator platforms of the future will bring together widely known and loved brands, distribution channels, creative partnerships, business opportunities, and purpose-built creator tools.
> 
> **Lead the future of AI-powered content and maximize the creativity of our writers, producers, and creators and our business.** The creative process will increasingly become AI-assisted and technology-enabled. If the past 15 years of the internet have been defined by algorithmic feeds that curate and recommend content, the next 15 years will be defined by AI and data helping create, personalize, and animate the content itself. Our industry will expand beyond AI-powered curation (feeds), to AI-powered creation (content). AI opens up a new era of creativity, where creative humans like us play a key role providing the ideas, cultural currency, inspired prompts, IP, and formats that come to life using the newest technologies.
> 
> **Here is how we are going to do it:**
> 
> Our teams at BuzzFeed, Complex Networks, Tasty, HuffPost and BuzzFeed News will serve as the braintrust, innovating new models, creating new formats, and developing new production models to help creative people reach more people and have a bigger impact.
> 
> Our business team will serve as the monetization experts, helping creators make the most money from their work, bringing new tech-powered products to market, and tapping into studio, commerce, and advertising opportunities.
> 
> And our tech, product, and select content teams will become the experts on the latest technologies, the best AI-models, and the most interactive formats in order to build industry-leading tools and bring creator ideas to life.
> 
> We already have significant scale and growth opportunities from creator initiatives across the company; and with a new mindset and added focus, we are set up to win. Across BuzzFeed, Tasty, Complex Networks and more, we’re connecting brands with the best emerging talent and publishers across the Internet.
> 
> That includes a wide variety of amazing talent in our Catalyst Creator’s Program: foodies backed by iconic brands like Tasty; identity-focused creators from brands like Cocoa Butter and Pero Like and beloved creators in the shopping space, who drive viral recommendations and brand purchases.
> 
> BuzzFeed, Inc.’s Catalyst creator network overall encompasses many more creators, with more than 280+ million total followers.
> 
> Over 20% of the BuzzFeed.com web audience is consuming creator made content.
> 
> On Instagram, Tasty’s Creator Residents and Creator collaborations generated more than one billion views in 2022.
> 
> HuffPost Voices and HuffPost Personal will attract 250 new contributors this year.
> 
> Last year for the first time, BuzzFeed News and HuffPost launched a 10-month residency for ten external creators who are focused on short-form video content that complements the incredible reporting from our newsrooms. The creators meet regularly with newsroom leaders to discuss ideas for content that riffs off, or is inspired by, our original reporting.
> 
> Next month we’re beginning to work with the first class of Complex Creators with over 15 new faces joining our roster of talent.
> 
> Our Creator, Webscouts, and Video Acquisition teams will partner with 600+ creators this year and are growing off of a base of over ten billion views in 2022.
> 
> The highest end creators – celebrities – are both hosting and appearing on our shows regularly, with talent like Sean Evans, our host, interviewing Viola Davis and Lizzo on Hot Ones; Joe La Puma hosting Mark Wahlberg and Idris Elba on Sneaker Shopping; and stars like Tom Holland and Chris Evans (finally!) playing with puppies.

> In total, today our wide variety of creator-powered businesses generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue and an audience of well over 200 million people.

We are well-positioned to take share in this lucrative and growing new market segment in the coming year.

> Our work in AI-powered creativity is also off to a good start, and in 2023, you’ll see AI inspired content move from an R&D stage to part of our core business, enhancing the quiz experience, informing our brainstorming, and personalizing our content for our audience. I’ll share more soon about the encouraging developments and new applications we are working on as AI models continue to advance. To be clear, we see the breakthroughs in AI opening up a new era of creativity that will allow _humans_ to harness creativity in new ways with endless opportunities and applications for good. In publishing, AI can benefit both content creators and audiences, inspiring new ideas and inviting audience members to co-create personalized content. When you see this work in action it is pretty amazing. I’ll share a preview of the content we’ll be launching in February at the All Hands later today.

> That’s our plan. We’ll fight for revenue and manage costs through this recession. We’ll build the best platform for creators. We’ll lead the future of AI-powered content. Throughout it all, we’ll stay true to our mission. This is all possible because of our strong brands, huge audience, and talented teams. Together we can build the future of media. It will be a worthy challenge and an exciting adventure.
