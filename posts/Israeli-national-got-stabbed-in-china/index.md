Israel has retaliated to the Hamas attack by airstrike and according to reports, now preparing for a ground assault in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli Defence Forces have issued a warning for around 50 per cent of Palestinians to move to the south of Gaza.

The Arab world, China and Russia are standing against Israel in this conflict and has numerous time demanded immediate peace.

The hatred towards Israel has also increased in the Muslim majority countries and also in China. Chinese nationals can be seen criticising Israel on their social media platform.

It is surprising to see now attacks are also being reported on Israeli nationals. Recently, A 50-year-old employee at the Israeli embassy in Beijing, China was stabbed Friday in front of a supermarket, Chinese police and the Israeli government said.

The Beijing police said it had arrested a 53-year-old suspect, who was from a foreign nation.

The 50-year-old victim was a family member of an Israeli diplomat. The Chinese police have not provided yet any motive behind the attack, and and it was unclear if it was connected to the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas.

“The employee was transferred to hospital and he is in a stable condition,” an Israeli government statement said, without giving additional details.

A video posted on social media showed a man with a knife grappling with another man on the ground and stabbing him several times, leaving a trail of blood stains on the sidewalk.

People, who worked in the Supermarket area, said that they had heard the victim shouting as the police vehicle and an ambulance arrived. 

The stabbing occurred as Muslims across the world took to the streets in large protests after Friday prayers over Israel’s intense bombing campaign in Gaza, following the unprecedented and deadly incursion by the militant group Hamas into southern Israel last Saturday.

No further details were released by either side. 

Israeli nations, especially those who are related to Israeli diplomats, should be given protection, but China has failed to do so.

It is a shame for the country's law enforcement that such incidents occur in broad daylight. The suspect who has been detained should be questioned and the motive must be shared with the world.

It is not normal for diplomats or their relatives to get stabbed thus, strict action must be taken and all countries should demand tighter security for their ambassadors and other diplomats.
