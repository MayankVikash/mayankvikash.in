title: Population in India - Is it Good or Bad for the 5th Largest Economy? Submission


---

India is currently the world's first-most populous country,
with a population of over 140.76 crores people. While a growing population can bring positive effects on an economy, such as increased 
workforce and consumer demand, it can also strain resources and put pressure
on infrastructure. Therefore, the impact of population growth on the 5th 
largest economy is a topic of debate among economists, policymakers, and the public.



a larger population can provide India with a larger workforce, which can lead to
increased production and economic growth. With a growing population, India can 
also have a larger consumer base, which can drive demand and stimulate economic 
activity. Additionally, a larger population can lead to more innovation and creativity, 
as there are more people contributing ideas and solutions to problems. The youthful population 
in India can be an asset in the form of the demographic dividend, where a higher proportion of 
working-age individuals can boost the economy's growth.



population growth in India can have both positive and negative effects on the 5th largest economy.
While a larger population can provide opportunities for growth, it can also put a strain on resources
and infrastructure. To manage population growth effectively, policymakers and stakeholders must take a 
holistic approach and implement policies that address the underlying social and economic challenges. 
With the right strategies in place, India can harness the benefits of a growing population while ensuring 
sustainable and equitable growth for all.
