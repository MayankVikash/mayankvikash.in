Prayer is a form of communication or spiritual practice in which individuals or communities express their thoughts, emotions, desires, gratitude, or supplications to a higher power, deity, or spiritual entity. It is a way to connect with the divine, seek guidance, offer praise, or request assistance. Prayers are performed differently depending on which part of the world one is in. People can perform them by writing, singing, reciting, speaking aloud, or in private in front of a priest. Prayers can be individual or communal, occurring in personal moments of solitude, during religious ceremonies, or as part of organized gatherings.

The content of prayer may vary depending on the purpose and beliefs of the person or group offering it. Prayers can encompass many themes, including expressions of gratitude, requests for blessings, forgiveness, healing, protection, guidance, or strength during challenging times. They can also include prayers for the well-being of others, for peace, or for the alleviation of suffering in the world.
Prayer is often seen as a way to establish or deepen a personal relationship with the divine, to find solace, and to align one's intentions and actions with higher principles or spiritual values. It connects with the transcendent, seeking comfort, inspiration, or a sense of purpose and direction in life. I pray regularly, but I do not agree that prayers have any role in changing things; I believe prayers help me become a better person, and I am the one who changes things.

I was a rude and disobedient child, like any other teenager. I did not value anything. I ignored instructions from my parents and teachers and started spending more time with my peers. I never showed empathy for others. One day, my father asked me to sit and listen to him. He told me about my bad behaviour and warned me that others would treat me the same way I behaved with them. He also pointed out that I was in bad company and should stop spending time with them. He made me realize my mistakes. When I asked how I could improve, he replied that I should start reading religious books and praying regularly. He was right. I was able to improve myself with regular prayers. I could find peace and solace when I sat for prayer.

I started noticing changes in myself just weeks after regularly attending family prayers. Whenever I did something wrong, I acknowledged it in front of someone, asked for their forgiveness, and promised to never repeat the mistake. I developed patience, empathy, and listening skills through prayers. I could understand the feelings of others and treat them the way I wanted to be treated. Prayers helped me develop morally and become a better person. I now speak more kindly to others and am always ready to help someone in need. Prayers helped me make a positive impact on others and myself too. I became more hopeful as I knew a higher power would help me in my need. Prayers made me a better person and they removed all the negative thoughts from my brain.
