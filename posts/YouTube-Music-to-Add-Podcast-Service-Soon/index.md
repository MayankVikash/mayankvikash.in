Nowadays, podcasts are in trend. You can get all sorts of entertainment just by listening to podcasts. Podcasts are of various genres like news, entertainment, music talks, interviews, audiobooks and even random talks.

Podcasts are easy to access through Spotify or Google Podcasts or any other podcast service. They are very informative and save time as you can listen to them while working or doing exercise in the gym.

Google has their Podcast service Google Podcasts. YouTube has made listening to podcasts easier as podcasts from their main app will now be available on YouTube Music.

YouTube has also made it easier to publish podcasts as anyone with a Google account can publish their podcasts right through YouTube Studio.

By default, all podcast videos on YouTube will be available on YouTube Music.

YouTube announced on Twitter their new feature:

On Wednesday,  [Google announced(opens in a new tab)](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/thread/213056645)  that podcasts will be now available on YouTube Music.

"All listeners can enjoy podcasts on-demand, offline, in the background, while casting and seamlessly switch between audio-video versions on YouTube Music," Google said in a blog post about the update, adding that you don't necessarily need a Premium account to listen to your podcasts on the app. "This podcast listening experience is different from our music listening experience where you need a Premium or Music Premium subscription to enjoy some of these features."

This feature is currently available in the US. YouTube has not announced when they will launch Podcasts in other countries.

I am writing an essay on Podcasts: their benefits and problems, which will be published on [https://mayankvikash.in/essays/](https://mayankvikash.in/essays/)
