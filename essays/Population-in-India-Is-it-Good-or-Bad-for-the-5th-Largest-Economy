description: A short essay on the increasing population in India.

Population refers to the total number of humans, animals, or plants inhabiting a particular place, region, state or country. According to the United Nations Population Report, India is expected to surpass China to become the most populous country by the middle of this year, with an overwhelming population of 1.42 billion. This essay will list some of the many merits that the fifth-largest economy and the world's largest democracy can have with this large population.

People are the backbone of a nation. A decreasing population is often disastrous and is one of the main faction that leads to the collapse of the nation. On the other hand, a larger population is not a burden but an important asset for the country. They can boost the economy, generate new innovative ideas, bring in foreign investments, and spread the culture to other regions. If there are more people, they will compete with each other for jobs and work to improve their skills and knowledge thus the country will have skilled workers ready to compete at the national as well as international level. Some will prefer to start a business, which will bring foreign investments. Some will join research institutions or start their own, which will help in the overall development of mankind. When there is a large number of people, they will also spend money, which will improve the economy. A large population means cheap labour which will attract foreign companies to set up manufacturing plants in the country. A large population means that a large number of films, books, magazines, and newspapers will be produced which will spread the culture and glorify the country's achievements.

Government tends to build infrastructure where several people are living. A large population means more infrastructure projects, more schools, more hospitals, and more urban cities, thus modernizing the country. According to Elon Musk, the world's second richest person, the population of eight billion is not enough if humans want to become interplanetary species. He is indeed right. Increasing population comes with a hundred problems but it also comes with a thousand benefits.
