Saatvik was a blacksmith who lived in the small village of Almora, located at the southern edge of the Kumaon Hills in Uttarakhand. He was a talented man who was skilled in his work. He did not have much wealth, but he led a happy life. Fate was not kind enough to Saatvik as he had lost sight while working when a few pieces of iron fell into his eyes. He was optimistic and a believer who always used to say, "God will never punish his children. I am sure he is just testing me." His wife Saanvi was always worried about him and their future. They were both now middle-aged and had no offspring to look upon them in the time when they got old. Saanvi never missed her prayers, and she was always kind to others because she knew she would also need help one day.

One evening, while returning from the temple, the old couple found a starving dog lying on the ground. Saatvik said, "What a poor creature! Let us take it home and keep it." Saanvi quickly agreed with Saatvik, and they took the dog home and fed him. "We will call him Akasa," said Saanvi when they reached home. Akasa was loyal to their masters and helped them with small chores. A few months passed by, Akasa had developed a deep bond with its new owners. There was news in the village about burglars who killed the wealthiest man after looting his house. The villagers were now careful and stopped to stay outside late at night. One night, the burglars stormed inside Saatvik's house. Their leader said, "Give us all you have if you want to live." Both couples replied, "Leave us. We have nothing to give you." At that time, Akasa came rushing from inside, bit the leg of the leader and started attacking other members. The burglars had to run away. The blind old man said, "See. What I used to tell you. God always looks after his children." 

Saatvik could not see the people, but he felt their hearts. He could feel the pain of the stray dog that none other felt. He had brought him home and kept it with him. When the time came, the dog showed its loyalty to its masters by saving their lives. It is true indeed, "God never abandon his children."
