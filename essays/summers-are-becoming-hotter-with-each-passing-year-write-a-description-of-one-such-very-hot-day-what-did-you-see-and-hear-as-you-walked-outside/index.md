India is famous all around the world for its different seasons and extreme as well as pleasant climate. The unique features of the Indian subcontinent are found nowhere else. India mainly experiences five seasons Spring, Summer, Monsoon, Autumn and Winter. Summer is considered the best among other seasons by the Indians, but its popularity is decreasing drastically each day as the temperatures are constantly increasing because of climate change. Summer is when the country experiences most death because of extreme weather conditions. It is becoming unbearable for the people as the day temperatures outside reach 50Â°C. Summer was often associated with fun and enjoyment, but that is not the case anymore.

Summers are one of the most exciting times for children as their schools shut down and given a month's rest from school. They could use their free time to learn a new activity, do creative things, or rest. But Summers are not like that anymore. Extreme heat can cause headaches and dehydration among youngsters, restricting their creativity as their brain seems to stop due to high temperatures. High temperatures also affect their productivity and study. I once experienced this blazing heat when I was with my Uncle. It was one of the most unforgettable experiences I ever had.

My school was just closed, and my summer vacation started. My uncle had asked me a month before to visit his new home in Jaisalmer, one of the most beautiful cities in India and the hottest too. I did not want to go because of the scorching heat, but my family insisted. We had a train a week later my school closed from Indore. Keeping the temperature in mind and respecting our budget, my father booked three Third AC tickets for us. It was a long train journey of twenty-six hours. We boarded the train at 7:25 AM.  Inside the train, it was cold in the morning. But it was not for a long time. As the sun rose, the train started getting hotter and hotter. The compartment was like an oven. The heat was unbearable in the afternoon, and the air conditioners felt to have stopped working. Somehow, we spent those six miserable hours, and a slight relief was felt in the evening.

Fortunately, the train reached Jaisalmer at the time. Uncle had come to pick us up. He is an engineer, that time working on a water supply project in the city. He recently got transferred from Indore for this project. He and his family shifted to their newly built house the previous month and were excited to show it to us. It had all the designs from my grandparent's old house where he and my mother lived when they were young. We were greeted by my aunt when we reached home. It was not a very big house at the colony's end, but it was attractive. The white shade of the house shined brightly in the sunlight and gave it a golden touch. It was spacious and did not feel small once we went inside. The interior was of a typical Rajasthani house - dark, royal colours on the walls, painting of deserts and camels. We were given drinks to cool our bodies and then had a delightful meal. We talked for hours about Uncle's work and other stories. Uncle offered to go with him for a morning walk to show me the new city.

The next day I woke up at six, which was unusual as I do not wake up before ten during holidays. It was the excitement of exploring the new city that woke me up. We had a light breakfast and left to explore the city at seven. It was pleasant outside in the morning, and the temperature was not too high. We went too far from home while talking. We went to the mall and bought local food from the stalls. It was not before nine that we noticed how far we had come. The temperature was increasing as the sun rose. It shined brightly, and the reflection of the sunlight from the ground could hit our eyes and make it difficult to look anywhere. Uncle had recently moved here, so he was also not used to the bright sunlight and hot temperature. When we decided for a walk the previous night, we completely forgot that we were not in Indore - the temperature here reaches fifty degrees during noon. When we left home, we came from the nicely built road, but seeing the rising temperature, we decided to switch to the short unpaved road that goes through the rural areas so we could reach home by ten thirty.

The rural area of Jaisalmer was entirely different from the urban area. There were not many trees, and the few which were there had no leaves on them. The houses were simple and did not give the royal feeling anymore. We were wearing shoes, yet the roads felt like it was boiling, and the heat could penetrate the shoes to roast our feet. The climate was different because it felt like the temperature had doubled. Our body was covered with sweat, which instantly evaporated when dropped on the ground.

When we left home in the morning, we could see a lot of birds flying in the cloudy sky, but now we can't see a single bird in the sky. We had seen a bird on the ground, suffering from the extreme temperature. He probably needed water, but we had none, so we picked it up and took it to a nearby house. The house owner was a kind man. He took the bird inside, gave it some water in a pot, and offered us cold water. It was so refreshing after we took the first sip from the glass; it felt like we were reborn. We had also not noticed any animals on the streets - no dogs, cats, not even cows. They had probably relocated because of the rising temperatures.

We reached home by ten fifteen and ate like we had not eaten for years. After some rest, we told everything we had experienced during the morning walk to the family members.

This story may show the issue as less significant, but it is pressing and one of the biggest problems in the modern world. Many animals, birds and even humans lost their lives due to heatstrokes. Summer had been expressed as a season of fun and enjoyment in the past, but in modern times it is no less than a nightmare. Crops get destroyed, lands become barren, and people get sick due to dehydration and hot temperatures. We need to take the necessary actions to protect ourselves and our surroundings from the impact of rising temperatures. The solutions include planting more trees, reducing carbon emissions and switching to renewable energy. We can help other living beings by placing a bowl of water outside the house for the birds and animals to drink. If we keep exploiting nature and do not take necessary actions, the earth will become a desert, with temperatures reaching over sixty degrees in a few centuries. We have to work hard if we want to make the Earth a better place for future generations.
