Imagine you are asleep in your house in the morning and suddenly you wake up due to the sounds of loud sirens, warning that your locality is under attack by rockets. You would surely be terrified. 

This is the situation that the Israeli citizens faced today at around 6:30 AM Israel Daylight Time (9 AM Indian Standard Time). The sirens were heard at Israel's Economic and Technical Centre, Tel Aviv and the regions near Gaza.

The Hamas militants had launched a surprise attack on Israel today. Hamas militants entered Israel through land, sea, and air, with some even using paragliders, Israel Defence Forces said.

The Israel Defence Forces said around 2000 rockets were fired at Israel while Hamas claims the number to be 5000. The exact numbers are still not confirmed and the reports of damages are yet to come. The damages can be estimated by bringing the 50-day war between the two sides in 2014 into perspective in which around 4000 rockets were fired. 

Hamas military commander Muhammad Al-Deif called the operation “Al-Aqsa Storm” and said that the assault on Israel was a response to attacks on women, the desecration of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the ongoing siege of Gaza.

Irony to his statement, the Hamas militants seem to attack Israeli women. According to a video circulating on Twitter, Hamas militants are parading a semi-naked dead body of an Israeli woman throughout the city in an open truck. There are also reports of 35 Israeli soldiers and several workers from Nepal and other countries being captured by the terrorist group.

Israel has responded to these attacks by launching "Operation Swords of Iron," striking several key points of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel’s response to the Hamas incursion will “exact a huge price” on the militant group. 

IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told CNN that “tens of thousands” of Israeli reservists have also been called up to help, adding that he hopes “there will be no more live terrorists in Israel” by the end of the day. He also said that Israel would be ready in case of an attack from Lebanon or Syria.

Leaders from all around the world have extended their support to Israel. 

“Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with the innocent victims and their families,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi [said on X](https://twitter.com/narendramodi/status/1710614655620534296). “We stand in solidarity with Israel at this difficult hour.”

“The U.S. unequivocally condemns the unprovoked attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians,” said Adrienne Watson, spokeswoman for the U.S. National Security Council. “We stand firmly with the government and people of Israel and extend our condolences for the Israeli lives lost in these attacks.”

“I am shocked by this morning’s attacks by Hamas terrorists against Israeli citizens,” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on X, formerly Twitter. “Israel has an absolute right to defend itself. We’re in contact with Israeli authorities, and British nationals in Israel should follow travel advice.”

The Saudi Foreign Ministry called for an “immediate halt to the escalation” between Israel and the Palestinians.

“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is closely following the developments of the unprecedented situation between a number of Palestinian factions and the Israeli occupation forces, which has resulted in a high level of violence on several fronts there,” the ministry said in a statement.



“Terrifying news reaches us today from Israel. We are deeply shocked by the rocket fire from Gaza and the escalating violence,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X. “Germany condemns these attacks by Hamas and stands by Israel.”

“I strongly condemn the current terrorist attacks against Israel,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on X. “I express my full solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones.”

“We call for restraint from all parties,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan said at a political party meeting Saturday. “They must refrain from aggressive acts.”

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called the conflict an “expected development” and denounced U.S. involvement in the region and American support of the Ukrainian military.

“Clashes between Hamas and Israel on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War come as an expected development. This is what Washington and its allies should be busy with,” Medvedev said on X. “The conflict between Israel and Palestine has been going on for decades, with the US the key player in it.”

“But instead of actively working at Palestinian-Israeli settlement, these morons have interfered with us, and are providing the neo-Nazis with full-scale aid, pitting the two closely related peoples against each other. What can stop America’s manic obsession to incite conflicts all over the planet?”

According to the state news agency, Reuters reported, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry warned of “grave consequences” for an escalation in tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.

It called for “exercising maximum restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further danger.”

The Qatari government blamed Israel for the violence while calling on both sides to halt attacks.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds Israel alone responsible for the current escalation due to this ongoing violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, the latest of which is the repeated raids on the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque under of the protection of Israeli police,” the ministry said in a statement.

India's foreign policy has always upheld the principles of peace, stability, and the fight against terrorism on the global stage. One prominent example of this commitment is India's unwavering support for the State of Israel in its battle against terrorism. Over the years, India has maintained a strong and steadfast relationship with Israel, recognizing the shared values of democracy and the common threat posed by terrorism. This article delves into India's stance in favor of Israel and its unequivocal condemnation of terrorism.

Shared Values and Mutual Respect:

India and Israel, despite being geographically distant, share a deep bond founded on mutual respect and cooperation. Both nations are democracies, committed to upholding individual rights, freedom, and the rule of law. This shared ethos forms the cornerstone of their relationship.

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, have fostered this bilateral relationship further. High-level visits and dialogues between the two countries have increased, leading to strengthened economic, technological, and security ties.

India's Strong Condemnation of Terrorism:

India has consistently condemned acts of terrorism, both on its own soil and on the global stage. The nation has been a victim of terrorism for decades, experiencing multiple terror attacks that have claimed innocent lives. This first-hand experience has made India empathetic to the security concerns faced by Israel.

India firmly believes that terrorism, in any form or manifestation, must be eradicated. This stance is aligned with Israel's own struggle against terrorism, particularly from groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. India has repeatedly denounced such acts of violence against civilians and has called for the perpetrators to be held accountable.

Supporting Israel's Right to Self-Defense:

India recognizes Israel's inherent right to self-defense and has consistently supported Israel in its efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. The recent escalation of violence, with Hamas launching rocket attacks on Israeli cities, underscores the urgency of ensuring Israel's security.

Prime Minister Modi, in his message of solidarity with Israel, emphasized that Israel has every right to defend itself against unprovoked attacks. This position aligns with India's belief in the sovereignty and security of nations to protect their citizens from terrorist threats.

United Against Extremism:

India's support for Israel is not just symbolic; it is backed by a pragmatic approach to counterterrorism. Both nations actively cooperate in areas such as intelligence sharing, defense technology, and counterterrorism strategies. This partnership strengthens the global fight against extremism and terrorism.

Furthermore, India has been instrumental in fostering dialogue between Israel and Palestine. India supports a two-state solution that recognizes the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians, emphasizing peaceful coexistence.

Public Support and Diplomatic Efforts:

The Indian public has also expressed its solidarity with Israel, with hashtags like "India is With Israel" trending on social media platforms. This outpouring of support reflects the sentiment of the Indian people who stand firmly with Israel in its fight against terrorism.

In diplomatic forums like the United Nations, India consistently advocates for the importance of addressing terrorism as a global issue. The country seeks to build a consensus on measures to combat terrorism effectively and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.

Conclusion:

India's unwavering support for Israel in its fight against terrorism is a testament to its commitment to global peace and security. The shared values of democracy, respect for human rights, and the condemnation of terrorism have cemented the bond between the two nations. India's stance reflects its belief that terrorism must be eradicated, and nations have the right to protect their citizens from harm.

As the world faces increasing security challenges from extremist elements, India's solidarity with Israel serves as a beacon of hope for global cooperation in the fight against terrorism. It is a reminder that nations with a shared commitment to peace and security can come together to confront and overcome the challenges posed by terrorism.

Peace is a universal aspiration that transcends borders, cultures, and ideologies. It is a state of harmony, where conflicts and violence are replaced by cooperation, understanding, and coexistence. In a world marked by political tensions, regional conflicts, and global challenges, the establishment of peace is not just a lofty ideal but an imperative for the well-being of humanity. This article explores the reasons why peace should be established and the steps that can be taken to achieve this crucial goal.

The Human Cost of Conflict:

Conflict and violence exact a heavy toll on human lives, leading to untold suffering and loss. War, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflicts have resulted in the displacement of millions, the destruction of infrastructure, and the loss of countless innocent lives. It is essential to recognize that behind every statistic lies a personal tragedy, a family torn apart, and communities shattered.

Economic and Social Consequences:

Conflicts also have far-reaching economic and social consequences. Scarce resources are diverted from development to defense, hindering progress in education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Social cohesion is eroded, leading to division and mistrust among communities. The economic and social costs of conflict are immense and hinder the prosperity and well-being of nations.

Preservation of Cultural Heritage:

Cultural heritage is an integral part of our shared human history. Conflict and war often result in the destruction of cultural artifacts, monuments, and historical sites, robbing future generations of their cultural identity and heritage. The establishment of peace is essential for the preservation and protection of these invaluable cultural treasures.

Environmental Sustainability:

Conflict and war can have devastating environmental consequences. The use of destructive weapons, the displacement of populations, and the disruption of infrastructure can lead to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. Achieving peace is crucial for the preservation of our planet and addressing environmental challenges.

Diplomacy and Conflict Resolution:

Peace is not simply the absence of conflict but the result of deliberate efforts to address and resolve disputes through peaceful means. Diplomacy, negotiation, and dialogue are powerful tools for conflict resolution. International organizations like the United Nations play a pivotal role in facilitating peaceful negotiations and mediating conflicts.

Promotion of Human Rights:

Peace is intrinsically linked to the protection and promotion of human rights. In times of conflict, human rights violations often occur, including the displacement of civilians, the denial of access to humanitarian aid, and the use of torture and violence. The establishment of peace is essential for upholding the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual.

Conflict Prevention and Resolution:

To establish and maintain peace, it is vital to address the root causes of conflicts, including political grievances, economic disparities, and social inequalities. Conflict prevention through early intervention and resolution mechanisms can help prevent conflicts from escalating into violence.

International Cooperation:

Peace is a global endeavor that requires international cooperation and solidarity. Nations must work together to address common challenges, promote dialogue, and build trust. Multilateral diplomacy and international organizations provide platforms for nations to collaborate in pursuit of peace.

Conclusion:

The establishment of peace is not a utopian ideal; it is a pragmatic and moral imperative. The human, economic, environmental, and cultural costs of conflict underscore the urgent need to prioritize peace. It requires the collective efforts of governments, international organizations, civil society, and individuals to work towards resolving conflicts, promoting dialogue, and fostering understanding among nations. In a world marked by challenges and uncertainties, peace remains the cornerstone of a better future for all of humanity. It is a goal worth pursuing relentlessly, for the sake of current and future generations.











India had always stood against all terror activities and had taken strict actions against it. We support the retaliation of Israel. The guilty should not go unpunished and the supporters should pay the price. The people of India are supporting Israel in all possible ways and "India is With Israel" is trending on Indian Twitter.

The war should end quickly and peace should be established. The United Nations Security Council has called for an emergency meeting this afternoon to discuss the situation in Israel.
