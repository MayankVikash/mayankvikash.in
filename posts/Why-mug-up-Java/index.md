title: Why mug up Java?

description: Learning a new language, check these points before enrolling in a course.

Hey Hackers,

I am Mayank Vikash, a school student with an interest in learning about new technologies. I am learning Java as a part of the school syllabus and I am loving it! By the way, I am glad to let you all know that I have been nominated for 2 awards:

# #[HACKERNOON CONTRIBUTOR OF THE YEAR- JAVA](https://www.noonies.tech/2022/programming/2022-hackernoon-contributor-of-the-year-java)

# #[HACKERNOON CONTRIBUTOR OF THE YEAR- MATHEMATICS](https://www.noonies.tech/2022/emerging-tech/2022-hackernoon-contributor-of-the-year-mathematics)

Thank you, Hackers and the Editors, for considering me worthy of nomination for these awards.

Coming to the topic. I want to discuss something that I felt important, I have been noting that in my class everyone is mugging up Java just to get good grades, yes they are mugging it up.

Yeah, I know you all will be asking how are they able to solve the logic.

To answer that, I don’t know what these people are doing and how.

So, if any of my classmates are reading this, I just want to tell you that Programming is not like history or Chemistry that you will think, you are gonna learn the keywords and you will master it. Programming is like a real-life situation where you spend your brain figuring out the possible ways to solve something.

I guess this is the situation of most learners around the world. So, in this article, I am gonna mention a few ways to outcome this weird habit of mugging up the program’s logic.

I have listed a few things to do before learning a language that may create an interest inside you to learn in.

## #Research

Before learning a new programming language why don’t just do some research like:

-   What is this language used for?
    
-   Why it was created?
    
-   Is it worth learning?
    
-   What can I make with help of this language?
    
-   What are others’ opinions about it?
    

## #Official website

The official website is the best place to know about a particular programming language and the field of its implementation. For example - this is the official website of [Python Language](https://www.python.org/). It gives a lot of information about Python, its frameworks, and its uses.

## #Documentation

It’s a good practice to read the documentation but documentations are too long and boring. I prefer first checking out the tutorials, for example, if you want to learn C++ then I would suggest you this tutorial from [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/). But if you are interested in learning Next.js then, I would suggest you check out their official [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs). Fun fact: Next.js powers this platform.

## #Practice

Ah, yes here comes the most important part, you need to practice writing programs regularly, without practicing you can never master a language. Participate in a quiz, hackathons, etc. Try building something on your own. Check this out on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) to practice java and improve your skills.

## #Projects

After you have completed tutorials and you are confident. You can start making projects, just look on the web for inspirations and ideas and then think what unique you can make, then build it, quite simple. I am also making a new portfolio website for myself.
