Education is vital for a child's growth and mental development. It impacts his behaviour and way of living, it also impacts a child's views about society and the world. The main source of primary and secondary education is schools. A child usually at the age of three or four is admitted to the school where he learns about the fundamentals of reading and writing and is introduced to numbers. The initial years at the school are just like a playground for the child. He is introduced to topics in a fun and playful manner such that he never forgets about those concepts till the end of his life. When he is promoted to grade 3, intermediate concepts like fractions, essays, and geometry are introduced to him. But as he enters grade 8, the curriculum starts to become more complex with the introduction of algorithms, algebra, email writing, descriptive and narrative essays, chemical reactions, intermediate physics, and biology. The situation worsens as he enters the ninth grade, where he is introduced to programming and logic building, along with a glimpse of advanced topics in physics, chemistry, and biology. It becomes worse with every successive year of his academic life. I would like to share an example from my personal life: I have exams starting next week, and the first one is in math. There are a total of 17 chapters to cover for the exam, and the level of stress that I and my classmates are experiencing is beyond imagination. In the words of a close friend, "I had solved all the chapters during the classes, but it is quite hard to remember every concept and formula. I don't know what to do because the syllabus is so vast, and I can't decide which chapter to prioritize."

The vast curriculum is often the cause of stress and diseases related to it. The constant need to cover the vast syllabus and the constant pressure from parents and teachers to perform well in numerous subjects can lead to stress and anxiety among students. The fear of falling behind and not meeting the expectations can be overwhelming as well the intense competition among the students can be another cause of strain. The limited time to cover the vast syllabus also leads to students memorizing the topics and not understanding them deeply, which defies the whole point of education as the students usually memorize the topics before examinations to gain marks. With the focus on completing the syllabus, students may have limited opportunities to engage in critical thinking, creative problem-solving, or meaningful discussions. These skills are crucial for holistic development. In an attempt to cover everything, students resort to rote memorization, which hinders the development of analytical skills and a genuine passion for learning.  A vast syllabus can lead to a scarcity of time for extracurricular activities, sports, and hobbies that play a vital role in a child's overall growth and development. The pressure to excel in a broad range of subjects can lead to sleep deprivation, reduced physical activity, and a decline in overall well-being.

I would like to suggest a few solutions for the above-mentioned issues caused due to a vast syllabus. Education authorities should consider revising and streamlining the curriculum to focus on essential concepts and skills rather than excessive content. This would allow for in-depth understanding. Reevaluate the assessment methods to emphasize critical thinking, problem-solving, and practical application of knowledge, rather than rote memorization. Allow students to have more choice in their education, enabling them to explore their interests and talents. This can be achieved through elective courses or personalized learning plans. Equip teachers with strategies for effective time management and innovative teaching techniques that promote understanding rather than coverage. Introduce stress management programs in schools to help students cope with the pressures of a demanding curriculum. Encourage open conversations about mental health. Recognize the importance of extracurricular activities and allocate time within the school schedule for these pursuits.

The vast syllabus in today's education system places a heavy burden on children, affecting their mental well-being, creativity, and overall development. Education policymakers, schools, and parents must address this issue by reevaluating curricula, promoting critical thinking, and providing support for students to manage stress effectively. Education should nurture a love for learning and holistic growth rather than merely focusing on content coverage. Balancing academic rigour with well-being is the key to fostering a generation of empowered, well-rounded individuals.
