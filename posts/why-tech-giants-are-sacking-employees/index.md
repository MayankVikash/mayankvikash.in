After the world's richest person, Elon Musk acquired the micro-blogging platform Twitter for 44 billion dollars he started his first day in the office by firing Twitterâ€™s top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ned Segal and legal affairs and policy chief Vijaya Gadde. Just a few days after that he is reported to fire a whole team of Data Engineers. Within a week after Chief Twit announced to lay off half the Twitter employees which are about 3700 employees out of 7500.

Unfortunately, Twitter is not the only giant to lay off its employees. The long list of companies sacking their employees includes Facebook's parent company Meta, Google's parent company Alphabet, Netflix, Byju's, Microsoft and many more.

Situations are similar in India. Around 15,708 in the country have lost jobs. The Indian companies included unicorns like BYJU'S, Ola, Meesho, and MPL.

The previous year, the Indian education platform Unacademy is reported to have laid off more than 1000 employees.

This year, US companies had around 45,000 employees laid off as of October 2022.

Tencent also froze hiring as a measure of cost-cutting.

The unicorn startup Byjus announced to lay off 2,500 employees, that is 5 per cent of its workforce, over the next six months. The company is sacking around 2,500 of its 50,000 employees.

## What is the reason for sacking employees

Tech firms around the globe are fighting economic slowdowns. The slow consumer spending, higher interest rates by central banks and strong dollars overseas are hinting towards a possible recession. As a result, tech firms including Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are laying off employees or freezing hiring.

Recently Indian IT companies including Wipro, Infosys and TCS have fired hundreds of employees for moonlight (simultaneously working for two or more companies).

IT firms are worried that employees taking up secondary jobs after regular work hours will affect productivity, lead to conflicts of interest and possible data breaches.

The most common reason for laying off employees is the pressure from investors and cost-reducing measures. Investors invest in companies in which they see growth potential. So these companies are removing their excess employees so to cut off their excess expenses as these Startups hired workers even when there was no immediate need for them.

## What's next for those who have lost their jobs

There is good news too, Twitter has reached out to its employees who were fired before to return to their positions.

Some of those who are being asked to return were laid off by mistake, according to two people familiar with the moves. Others were let go before management realized that their work and experience may be required.

It is not easy to get a new job during this time of economic crisis. Those who have lost jobs should invest their time in personal development and skills improvement and should regularly practice for example if you design UI, you must keep practising your skills so that when you get time to apply for a new job, you perform better than others. You can also learn something new, if you are good at frontend development, try learning backend development. Remember to keep looking for new job offers on LinkedIn. Tech giant's employees are likely to hire by small startups as they have lots of experience.
