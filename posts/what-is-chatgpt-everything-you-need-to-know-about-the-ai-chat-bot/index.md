ChatGPT is an online Artificial Intelligence chatbot, developed by OpenAI. The AI-powered chatbot can do every sort of work from generating codes based on explanations to answering questions in the best possible way. As the name suggests, ChatGPT is great for chatting too. It can create content for your website, explain difficult concepts, and take tests.

The service was launched on 30th November 2022.

Recently ChatGPT got temporarily down due to the high volume of traffic and after reaching 1 million users.

The website says, "ChatGPT is at capacity right now"

The website also adds, "We're experiencing high demand. Please hang tight as we work on scaling our systems."

The OpenAI team also added a rap "about the status of ChatGPT."

"Yeah, yo, what's up ChatGPT fam

A lot of people trying to jam

But don't worry, we got your back

Just check back soon, we'll get on track

ChatGPT's the place to be

For all your AI chat needs

We're working hard to keep up the pace

So hold tight, we'll be back in this space

So don't you worry, don't be mad

We're working hard, it's not so bad

Just give us time, we'll be back

ChatGPT, the future of chat, that's a fact."

ChatGPT uses advanced machine learning and artificial techniques to understand users' queries and generate the best response. The Chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to understand the statement and generate a reply as a real human would.

It has an automated trainer, which means every time you type a question, it analyzes every word you enter and learns more about how to deliver the best answer. It is similar to practising maths, when you solve maths questions you learn new things by practising similarly ChatGPT learn by practising. Another real-world example is when you learn art, you are advised to practise new drawing regularly so that you can add something new to your skills.

Front-End Developers also practise regularly by making new websites and designs so they can compete with other Front-End developers around the world.

ChatGPT has vast **training data** which is provided by the developer so that they can generate answers according to the information provided. It constantly updates the training data from online sources and by practising.

The AI bot is trained with a wide range of knowledge in different fields which it can apply to get the desired output. It is similar to humans, if someone has learned to build homes, he can use his learnings to create new and unique designs of homes which he has not learned. Thus ChatGPT technology works similarly to human brains which have stored basic knowledge that can be applied to different fields.

ChatGPT also includes the principles of InstructGPT which take directions from humans.

The Home Screen of ChatGPT's website highlights a few limitations of the AI Chatbot.

1.  The first limitation of ChatGPT is that it "may occasionally generate incorrect information" which is common for chatbots but if ChatGPT does something unusual, you will find out about it ahead.
    
2.  The homepage says that it "may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content"
    
3.  The third limitation that the website states about it have "limited knowledge of world and events after 2021." I guess they fired the people during the pandemic who were working on the training data which is why the AI Chatbot has limited knowledge of the present world.
    

I am not surprised to know that ChatGPT officially accepts a few limitations of their chatbot rather I appreciate them. At least, they are accepting their limitations. I mean you make something with years of hard work and then you are also accepting what are the limitations of your products.

There are a few other limitations to ChatGPT (actually, these limitations apply to all Chatbots) which they do not seems to mention anywhere.

1.  ChatGPT usually doesn't answer questions like "how to make explosives". It is programmed to avoid questions on certain topics like graphic violence, questions which are harmful, etc.
    
2.  ChatGPT requires lots of details to deliver the best answers. The worse things about chatbots are that they are dumb. ChatGPT is also dumb but it is better than other that I have tried, but still if you want ChatGPT to generate a good answer you need to provide all the points and details which you want to include.
    
3.  If you are using ChatGPT to generate content for your website then I would advise you to stop it. Researchers at Google spent years trying to build an algorithm that can detect AI-generated content and they have successfully built it. Always remember that auto-generated content violates Google's policies.
    
4.  Did you know OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT watermarks all of their product's content including ChatGPT which means they can if a piece of content is generated through ChatGPT or not? OpenAI uses cryptographic watermarking, which helps detect the content generated through ChatGPT. They detect it through the choice of words, punctuation etc.
    
5.  One of the major problems with Chatbots is that they provide a ton of wrong information and ChatGPT tops this position. It is so confident that the wrong answers
    

Chatbots are one of the most innovative inventions of this century. As you already know innovative inventions cost a lot. ChatGPT also requires a lot of money to operate. OpenAI uses Microsoft Azure servers for hosting its products. According to the estimates on the Internet, OpenAI pays 100K dollars each day for the operation of ChatGPT. It means ChatGPT would cost around 3 million dollars a month.

Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI said on December 5th that OpenAI pays a cent to generate every response.

Currently, ChatGPT is free to use but soon OpenAI will make it paid. I hope the company could make ChatGPT a profitable chatbot.

It is almost the end of the year and it is expected from the next year 2023 the Chatbot service will no longer be free to use.

ChatGPT is one of the fastest services to reach its first million users. It got its first million users within 5 days of launch. Although these users are not permanent the Chatbot was also able to secure lots of permanent users that are willing to pay for the service.

Just a random fact, Elon Musk now the world's second richest founded OpenAI with Sam Altman and others in 2015. Musk is currently not a board member at OpenAI but he is a donor to the non-profit organization.

Let me tell you about my experience with Chatbot.

I decided to spend 10 minutes with ChatGPT, trying random questions. I appreciate how informative the Chatbot is. It answered my question quickly and very precisely. I learned lots of new things. I also experienced that the Chatbot can understand what I am looking for. I spend a lot of my time with Google but I never experienced this ease of getting the right answer which you are looking for.
