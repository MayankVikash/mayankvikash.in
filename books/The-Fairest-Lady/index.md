**An Unthinkable Choice:** In the throes of despair, as the prince lay on the brink of death, a figure emerged from the darkness—the devil himself. With a sinister offer, he presented the prince with a choice: embrace a life of darkness and power in exchange for the promise of revenge.

**The Devil's Pact:** Battered by grief and anger, the prince's choice was made—a pact with the devil that bound him to a life of eternal darkness. He embraced his newfound power, unleashing a force that consumed all in its path.

**A Reign of Evil:** The prince's newfound power morphed him into the oldest and most powerful being on earth—a harbinger of evil who wielded dominion over darkness itself. With his might, he wrought destruction upon the world, a reflection of the pain that had once consumed him.

**Love Lost and Reborn:** Yet, within the depths of his power, the prince clung to a shred of humanity—a yearning for the love he had lost. The devil whispered to him that his lost love would be reborn, setting the stage for a reunion that would reshape the course of fate.
