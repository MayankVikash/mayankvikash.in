title: Introducing Search for mayankvikash.in 
description: Now you can search the entire mayankvikash.in by just typing a few words and pressing search.

On 14th January 2023, I added the search feature to this site.

You can now visit the [Search section](https://mayankvikash.in/search/) and search the entire site by just entering the words you are looking for and you will get the related article or image after pressing search. 

The Search is powered by Google. I used Google's [Programmable Search Engine](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/) for this purpose.

Currently, I am using the default theme with Google's branding but soon I will customize it. I tried creating a custom dark theme but it didn't work. For now, I will use the default theme.

## How to use the Search 

If you are struggling to use the Search Engine. This short guide will be helpful.

- Go to the [Search Section](https://mayankvikash.in/search/) 
- Click on the Search bar
- Enter the words you want to search for (just like in the image below) and press enter
