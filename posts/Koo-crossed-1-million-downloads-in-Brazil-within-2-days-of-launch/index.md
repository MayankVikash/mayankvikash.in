Indian microblogging platform, Koo has secured the top position on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store in Brazil. Indian Twitter alternative platform Koo App on Monday 21st November 2022 said it has received a strong response from users in Brazil, crossing over 1 million downloads within 48 hours of launch in the country.

Koo said in a statement that: “India’s multilingual microblogging platform, Koo App, was launched in Brazil with the addition of the Portuguese language, making it available in 11 native languages now”.

"We saw more than a million users from Brazil join Koo in the last 48 hours and with one of the highest engagement ever seen. Brazil is big on social media and speaks Portuguese, the native language. Koo has become a cult brand in Brazil that enjoys an unbelievable fan following. We are proud to have started the movement of 'Make in India, Make for the World' in the tech product world. We have made Brazil fall in love with India. With every new language and country launched, we will be getting closer to our mission of uniting a world that is divided by language-barriers," said Mayank Bidawatka, Co-founder, Koo in the official statement.

Mayank Bidawatka also said: “We are proud to have started the movement of ‘Make in India, Make for the World’ in the tech product world.”

Indian Twitter has crossed over 1 crore (10 million) downloads in Google Play Store. It has claimed to have more than 50 million users worldwide and is already available in 100+ countries including the US, UAE, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Koo is also launched in Nigeria and became popular after the country banned the American microblogging platform Twitter. The country lifted the ban after 7 months when Twitter agrees to the conditions proposed by the government. The Blue Bird was banned in the country two days after it removed the Nigerian President's post. The ban was started on June 5 2021 and lasted till January 13 2022.

Koo is successfully able to be an alternative to Twitter after billionaire Elon Musk acquired it. The platform has high ambitions of capturing Global Markets with its regional language support. The Yellow Bird has recently launched the Portuguese language which is the official and national language of Brazil. Koo is now available in 11 languages. Twitter rival Koo has become the 2nd largest multi-lingual microblogging platform available.

After the launch in the country of Brazil, famous Brazilian celebrities including Rosana Hermann, Babu Santana, Claudia Leitte, and the News outlet Choquei have also joined Koo App.

Soon the Yellow Bird will also have support for more foreign native languages including Arabic, Spanish, French, German, Korean, Japanese and others, according to the app information.

## What is Koo?

If you live in China and don't know what is happening and why the Internet is so exciting about this app then let me give you a quick introduction to Koo.

Koo is a microblogging social media app that was launched in March 2020 by a Bengaluru-based start-up. It is also being called India’s homegrown alternative to Twitter.

Koo is a social networking service which allows users to share their thoughts in 400 characters while Twitter has a limit of 280 characters. It also allows users to post in their native languages.

The social networking service is owned by Bombinate Technologies Pvt Ltd and is valued at over 100 million dollars. Koo's parent company is a Bengaluru-based startup and also operates Vokal, an Indian version question and answer site Quora.

After billionaire Elon Musk purchased Twitter for 44 billion dollars, Twitter users started looking for other alternatives and Koo just ranks at the top among them. The Indian platform is also giving jobs to ex-Twitter employees after they were fired by Elon Musk to reduce costs.
