"A Road Trip is a long journey on an automobile." The definition in my dictionary reads, but I would like to add much more to it. It is not just a road journey where you enjoy the outside scenery while you sit inside your car or where you can enjoy the experience of driving at hundred miles per hour. It is a journey where you form memories with your families and friends; you form deeper bonds with them and enjoy being "social" in the real world and not on social media. Road Trips become more significant in this digital age when youths are getting away from each other and where they have created a different meaning of socialising. It is also one of the reasons why until recently, I have never been on a road trip.

It was February of 2022. The weather was bitterly cold, and my final exams had just ended. On the Friday of the third week of the month, my father came home after work as usual, and out of the blue, he announced to us that he and his friends had planned a road trip to Digha in West Bengal on Sunday. I would usually get excited, but it was winter that would not let my mind release the dopamine for this adventurous trip to a beach. 

We woke at three on Sunday morning and started preparing for the tedious but exciting road journey. We left our house sharply at five and embarked on the trip for which my parents were excited, but I still did not understand the need to go to a beach in cold weather. My father's friends and their families shortly joined us at National Highway 18. At the commencement of our journey, I experienced a slight drowsiness. However, the enthralling scenery of Jamshedpur quickly dispelled any traces of fatigue, leaving me immersed fully in the beauty of the surroundings. Jamshedpur's landscape during our road trip was captivating, with lush green mountains embracing the city. The seamless integration of urban infrastructure with nature impressed us. The rivers added to the charm, and the play of sunlight and shadows created a dynamic landscape. It was a sensory delight, leaving an indelible mark on our hearts.

We reached Digah by noon. It was a long journey, and we were tired, so we quickly looked for a hotel that suited our needs and pockets and got in our rooms to rest. In the evening, we went to the beach to enjoy the famous sunset of Digha Beach. The sky transformed into a mesmerizing canvas of colours. The sun dipped gracefully on the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the tranquil waters. The waves gently lapped against the shore, creating a soothing melody. The sand glowed like molten gold in the fading light. As the sun bid its farewell, the sky painted itself in hues of pink, orange, and purple, captivating all who beheld the breathtaking spectacle. The peaceful ambience and the sheer beauty of the moment made the sunset at the beach a magical and unforgettable experience.

We enjoyed the sunset till the very night arrived. We went back to our rooms as we had to return to Jamshedpur early the next morning. Our return journey was equally enjoyable, and we talked a lot throughout the way. I made several new friends, and it was the first time in months I had been outside Jamshedpur. The trip will always be memorable to me, and the memories created during this period will always be close to my heart.
