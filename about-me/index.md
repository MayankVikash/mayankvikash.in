Welcome! I'm Mayank Vikash, an enthusiastic individual with a wide range of hobbies and interests, including technology, writing, design, international affairs, and being a student. I was born on August 16th, 2007, in the vibrant city of New Delhi, India.

Although not a professional in these fields, I find immense joy and fulfilment in pursuing these hobbies. Let me share a bit about each of them.

Technology has always fascinated me, and I have delved into various aspects of it, particularly in the realm of programming. Java is a programming language I enjoy working with, as it allows me to create innovative solutions and build robust applications. While my expertise may not be at a professional level, I am passionate about learning and exploring new technologies, constantly challenging myself to improve.

Writing is another hobby that brings me great pleasure. I love expressing my thoughts and ideas through essays, short stories, and even books. Though not a published author, I find immense satisfaction in crafting compelling narratives that transport readers to new worlds and explore the depths of human experiences. Writing serves as a creative outlet for me, and I continually strive to improve my skills and refine my storytelling techniques.

Design is an area where I enjoy applying my creativity and visual sensibilities. While not a professional designer, I appreciate the aesthetics and usability of digital products. Through my hobbyist endeavours, I seek to create visually appealing designs that enhance the user experience. I experiment with various design elements, from user interfaces to logos and branding, aiming to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics.

In addition to my hobbies in technology, writing, and design, I have a keen interest in international affairs. I actively follow global events, geopolitical developments, and international relations. Exploring the complexities of different cultures, societies, and political systems broadens my perspective and informs my understanding of the world.
